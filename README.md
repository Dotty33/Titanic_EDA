Table of content:
1. Project files explanaition
2. Task description
3. Task purpose
4. The learning objectives

1. File - Titanic.csv - This is the database the EDA is performed on.
   File Titianic.ypynb - code record

2. This is in-depth EDA on the Titanic dataset provided including descriptions of the EDA and visualisations.
  
3. Task Objective - These are the guiding questions the EDA is based on:
   
● What is the most important factor in determining survival of the Titanic
incident?
● In the movie, the upper-class passengers were given preference on
lifeboats. Does this show in the data?
● “Women and children first”. Was this the case?
● Add one other observation that you have noted in the dataset.

4. The learning objective is to use the appropriate coding styles to find explore the data in details and to seek answers and conclude the findings.
   The second aspect was to use visualisation techniques to present the findings in a user frinedly manner.
